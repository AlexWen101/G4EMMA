Branch has been merged, latest version. Now trying to resolve the seg fault issue when I try to run anything other than an alpha source. 

UPDATE: there is no more seg fault. Looks like using GeneralParticleSource instead of ParticleGun made the difference! 

Some nominal values for EMMA: 

Energy acceptance: +25% -17%
m/q acceptance: +/- 3.5%
mass dispersion in focal plane: 10 mm/%
angular acceptance: +/- 3.6 deg by +/- 3.6 deg (15 msr)
