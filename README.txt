This branch is a reset version (without any of my or Nadege's changes) straight from
master. The newest version keeps seg faulting for reasons unknown, so 
for the time being I am using the default branch for my work. 

Once the seg fault issue is resolved, we can merge the branches later. 

Note that Nadege's work isn't in this branch. It will have to be merged.
